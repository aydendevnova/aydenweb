The design system uses a warm neutral foundation with cream background (#F7F3EF) and dark brown text (#2C2416) to avoid the sterile quality of pure white while maintaining high readability. Burnt orange (#C1502E) serves as the sole accent color, applied exclusively to interactive elements like links and buttons to create clear affordances without visual noise. Typography establishes hierarchy through scale and weight rather than color: Crimson Text serif at 60px for the name, 40px for section headings, and 24px for subheadings, paired with Inter sans-serif at 16px with 1.6 line-height for body text. Spacing follows an 8px grid with generous whitespace between sections to let content breathe. No gradients, shadows, or decorative elements appear anywhere. Cards for case studies use a subtle border in a darker cream tone rather than elevation effects. The system prioritizes information density and scanability over visual flourish, with every design decision serving legibility and content hierarchy rather than aesthetic demonstration.
